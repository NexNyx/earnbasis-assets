    <h2>Why Forex Risk Management Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Successful traders know that <strong>risk management is more important than strategy</strong>.  
      Without a clear plan for managing risk, even the best entries can lead to devastating losses.  
      This cheat sheet condenses the most important principles — from calculating stop-loss distances to adjusting position size based on volatility.
    </p>

    <h2>What You’ll Learn Inside</h2>
    <p>
      Inside the PDF you’ll find a step-by-step guide to controlling your trading risk.  
      You’ll learn how to apply the <strong>2% rule</strong>, manage leverage in Forex pairs, and protect your capital during high-volatility sessions like London and New York open.  
      With formulas and ready-to-use examples, you can implement these rules immediately.
    </p>

    <h2>Common Mistakes Traders Make</h2>
    <p>
      Many traders repeat the same errors over and over: moving stop-losses, risking too much per trade, or scaling up after a loss.  
      This cheat sheet shows you <strong>exactly how to avoid those traps</strong> and stay consistent under pressure.
    </p>

    <h2>Example: €10,000 Account Position Sizing</h2>
    <p>
      Suppose you trade with a €10,000 account and apply the 2% rule.  
      – Max risk per trade = €200  
      – Stop-loss distance = 50 pips → €4 per pip  
      – Lot size = 0.40 lots on EUR/USD  
      This type of calculation is broken down step-by-step inside the PDF so you can apply it to any account size.
    </p>

      This asset is perfect for:  
      – Beginner traders who want a simple, proven framework  
      – Funded account challengers who must respect drawdown rules
