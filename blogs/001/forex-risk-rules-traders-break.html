      <h1>5 Risk Management Rules Forex Traders Break (and How to Fix Them)</h1>
      <p class="lead">Most traders don‚Äôt blow up because of bad strategies‚Äîthey blow up because of ignored risk. Here are the 5 most broken rules in Forex risk management, and practical ways to fix them.</p>

      <h2>Why risk management matters more than strategy</h2>
      <p>You can have a mediocre entry system and still grow your account‚Äîif your risk is under control. On the other hand, even the best setups fail if you overexpose yourself. Funded trading firms know this: most rules are about risk, not setups. Prop traders often lose their accounts not because of poor signals, but because they violated risk caps.</p>

      <h2>1) Risking too much per trade</h2>
      <p>It‚Äôs tempting to think, ‚ÄúIf I risk 5%, I‚Äôll grow faster.‚Äù In reality, it destroys you faster. A string of 4‚Äì5 losses can wipe out 25%+ of your account, making recovery nearly impossible.</p>
      <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Stick to <strong>0.5‚Äì1% risk per trade</strong>. It feels slow, but it compounds. Professional traders focus on survival, not speed.</p>

      <h2>2) Moving (or deleting) your stop-loss</h2>
      <p>Shifting stops is emotional, not strategic. Traders move their SL a few pips lower hoping the market ‚Äúcomes back.‚Äù Usually it doesn‚Äôt.</p>
      <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Place your stop behind real structure (swing highs/lows, support/resistance zones). If you get stopped, the trade idea is invalid. Log each time you move a stop‚Äîit‚Äôs an eye-opener.</p>

      <h2>3) Revenge trading after a loss</h2>
      <p>Every trader has felt it: you lose a trade and instantly look for another setup to ‚Äúmake it back.‚Äù The result? A spiral of impulsive trades.</p>
      <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Define a <strong>daily loss cap</strong> (e.g., ‚àí2R). Once hit, you‚Äôre done for the day. Professional firms enforce this rule for a reason: it saves accounts.</p>

      <h2>4) Random take profits</h2>
      <p>Many traders exit ‚Äúbecause it looks good.‚Äù Without structured targets, you either cut winners short or let greed take over.</p>
      <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Use R-multiples or structure levels. Example: TP1 at 1R (risk-to-reward), TP2 at 2R, scale out. It builds consistency and data you can track in your journal.</p>

      <h2>5) No daily or open-risk limit</h2>
      <p>This is the silent account killer. Without caps, you can stack multiple trades and unknowingly risk 10%+ in one session.</p>
      <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Cap <strong>daily loss</strong> (e.g., ‚àí2R) and <strong>max open risk</strong> (‚â§2%). Better to take fewer, higher-quality setups than overload your account.</p>

      <h2>Case study: funded trader mistakes</h2>
      <p>We‚Äôve seen traders with $50k funded accounts lose them in under a week‚Äînot because their setups were bad, but because they risked 3‚Äì5% per trade, doubled down after losses, and ignored daily loss limits. If they had followed the simple 1% rule and capped open risk, they would still be in the game.</p>

      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Is 1% risk always safe?</strong> For beginners, yes. Advanced traders might go to 2%, but only with strict rules.</li>
        <li><strong>Do prop firms allow martingale?</strong> No. Nearly all have strict daily loss and max risk caps.</li>
        <li><strong>What about gold (XAU/USD)?</strong> Gold moves faster. Use smaller lot sizes to keep % risk consistent.</li>
      </ul>
